The successful applicant's designs will be used in the by the company's customers in a web application. In addition, the applicant must have extensive experience in the use of HTML5 and CSS3. Morreover, the applicant must be able to use Bootstrap 3 while having the capability of delivering an application which Responsive on multiple technological platforms such as mobile phones, tablets etc. Aside from these basic requirements, Nexmo would like their applicant to have knowledge of using Jquery/Javascript (for forms and complex interactions).

             <!-- <h1></h1> -->

             <hr>
             <p>Second job - Microsoft Software Developer (Experis): <a href="https://www.experis.co.uk/job/microsoft-software-developer-jobid-j376497a?utm_source=indeed&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=none&utm_content=software_developer&utm_campaign=newday_nov_2017" target="blank">readme</a> </p>
             <p>In this second job role, Experis are looking for an experienced software developer to be part of their digital transformation. Full stack training for all positions will also be given to the successful applicant.</p>
             <p>Moreover, Experis, unlike Nexmo are requiring their applicant to be able to possess certain essential criteria, such as: 'C# and .Net developmental skills, Experience with developing digital applications in a cloud environment, and also experience with test driven development, version controlled environments (ideally Bit Bucket, Git) and continous integration methodology and tools.'</p>
             <p>Furthemore, Experis also stated on certain desirable experience they'd like their applicants to have, which may be beneficial for the job role. These are the following:</p>
             <p>- Strong Azure service Fabric development experience.</p>
             <p>- API design and developmental experience.</p>
             <p>- Knowledge of service oriented Architecture principles.</p>
             <p>There are also senior positions available to applicants with additional experience.</p>
             <p>To conclude, the second job role which I experienced required extensive experience compared to the initial. As the latter role is also linked to development for Microsoft, it also boasts with a larger salary than the first role.</p>
