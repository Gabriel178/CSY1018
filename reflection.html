        <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
        <p>In my reflection, I will share my experience of studying Web Development in the first time of my 'Web Development' module.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>So far in the last 2 months of studying Web Development, I would have to say that I initially found it challenging in the first two weeks as I had never coded with HTML or CSS. However, the lectures and extra tutorial sessions have enabled me to gain better knowledge and also the ability to understand the basics of web coding. Furthermore, by me also talking and making friends with people in my lectures/tutorials, this helped me gain a better insight of how to execute the use of tags and elements. On the other hand, by watching youtube videos, this enhanced my knowledge a lot more. I am now able to use tags and elements effectively. In addition, my skills in CSS is a lot better as I am familiar with how to use hexadecimal numbering systems for colours. I am also able to allocate headers and footers in the places which I desire. Moving on, I've felt that the pace which Web Development has been taught this term was quite quick, which is of course beneficial for those who have previous experience using HTML and CSS, but proved slightly challenging for people like myself who have little to no experience. Overall, I have enjoyed my first term learning Web Development and hope my knowledge increases as I proceed into the second term post-Christmas break.</p>
